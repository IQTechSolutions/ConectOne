                <p>
                    Clients are provided with travel and/or other services and/or goods either
                    by the Company itself or by Third Party Suppliers who it engages as agent
                    for the Client - they include airlines, vehicle rental, providers of
                    accommodation, food and beverage, golf courses, tour guides, excursions
                    etc. The <strong>contract in use by the Third Party Suppliers </strong>
                    (which is often constituted by the ticket issued by them), shall constitute
                    the sole contract between the Third Party Supplier and the Client and any
                    right of recourse the Client may have, will be solely against such Third
                    Party Supplier. The Company will on request provide the identity and terms
                    and conditions of (or access thereto) all the Third Party Suppliers
                    relevant to the service and/or goods being provided for the Client's
                    booking and it's the Client's responsibility to familiarise itself with
                    such terms and conditions (    <strong><em>'the Third Party Supplier's Conditions'</em></strong>). Whilst
                    the Company vets and selects the Third Party Suppliers with the utmost care
                    and circumspection, the Company accepts <strong>no liability</strong> for
                    any loss, damage, illness, harm, injury or death which any Client may
                    suffer or claim of whatever nature it may have as a result of any act or
                    omission on the part of or the failure of the Third Party Supplier to
                    fulfill any of its obligations, whether in relation to travel arrangements,
                    accommodation or otherwise unless, in the case of injury or death, it is
                    due to the negligent act or omission of the Company.

                <p>
                    With regards to <strong>hotel bookings</strong> please be aware that hotels
                    and other accommodation properties (Collectively referred to as    <strong><em>'hotels'</em></strong>) may undergo renovations from time to
                    time. Hotels generally take all possible steps to limit disruption and
                    inconvenience to their guests when renovations are taking place. The
                    Company will not entertain complaints or requests for refunds if a hotel is
                    carrying out renovations whilst a guest is resident. If the Company is
                    specifically advised of renovation work in advance by the hotel, this
                    information will be passed on to the Client but it is important to
                    understand that this is subject to change and that the Company may not
                    always be notified.

                <p>
                    The Client acknowledges that it has selected the Itinerary and
                    destination(s) constituting the Booking based on information gleaned from
                    brochures and/or the Internet. It also acknowledges that such brochures
                    and/or the Internet have been compiled and are managed and updated by Third
                    Party Suppliers over which the Company has no control. Accordingly, the
                    Company cannot and does not guarantee that any destinations will comply in
                    whole or in part with such brochure and/or Internet. Any right of recourse
                    in that regard will be against the Third Party Supplier.

                <p>
                    A <strong>deposit </strong>based on the total package price ('the Package
                    Price') as specified in the Booking Confirmation ('the Booking
                    Confirmation') is required in order to secure the reservation, subject to
                    payment of the balance of the Package Price as specified herein. The
                    purpose of the Deposit, other than payment to Third Party Suppliers, is to
                    cover costs, disbursements incurred by the Company and its service fees. A
                    percentage of the deposit will be forfeited in the event of cancellation by
                    either party or if performance has become impossible for any reason
                    whatsoever and howsoever arising, which percentage will relate to the
                    Company's services rendered and amounts disbursed to service providers on
                    your behalf that cannot be recovered. However wherever possible the Company
                    will offer you a voucher for future travel and if accepted, there will be
                    no forfeit.

                <p>
                    100% of all flight tickets forming part of the itinerary will have to be
                    paid as part of the initial deposit to secure negotiated fares. The Company
                    reserves the right to cancel any reservation if the deposit is not
                    received. Upon receipt of    <strong>The Booking Confirmation and deposit</strong>, you will be deemed
                    to have confirmed all the information pertaining to your Itinerary ('The
                    Itinerary') as correct and the Company will, subject to availability, make
                    the reservations necessary to secure the Itinerary.

                    seats/accommodation/car hire or any other group arrangements on

                    hire or any other group arrangements on offer/discussed/confirmed and the

                    · Please note that often more than one itinerary is prepared during the

                <p>
                    Payment policy is as per the Booking Confirmation.<strong> </strong>The    <strong>balance of the Package Price </strong>is due not later than 60 days
                    prior to arrival unless specified otherwise. If the final payment is not
                    received on time, the travel documents can be delayed and may necessitate
                    the use of a <strong>courier service</strong>, which will be for the
                    Client's account or the Company may cancel the Itinerary. The Client
                    undertakes to pay the Company interest at a rate of 5% above the prime rate
                    charged by the Company's bank on any payment made after the due date. Late
                    payment may also result in cancellation of the reservation by any of the
                    Third Party Suppliers.

                <p>
                    Note that the Company reserves the right to amend the Package Price if an
                    unreasonable <strong>time lapses</strong> between the date the quotation is
                    submitted to the Client and the date it is accepted by the Client. However,
                    once payment of the Package Price in full is received, the Package Price is    <strong>guaranteed </strong>(subject to statutory changes such as VAT).
                    However, should the number of traveling passengers deviate from the number
                    required for the booking as specified in the Booking Confirmation or should
                    unforeseen events lead to rescheduling by any principal, the Company
                    reserves the right to re-cost the Package Price and raise a surcharge to
                    cover such costs. Should any Client refuse to accept and pay such    <strong>surcharge</strong>, the Company reserves the right to cancel the
                    tour and retain any payment made. (The <u>Company</u> will be entitled to
                    retain any service fees charged and/or retain the commission earned and/or
                    charge an administration fee). However, <strong>airfares</strong> are
                    subject to the price and conditions quoted by the airlines and cannot be
                    guaranteed (<strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: This applies especially regarding
                    airport taxes for the entire journey). Please note that the Price excludes
                    inter alia airport departure tax and any expenses of a personal nature and

                    The Company, its directors, members, partners, employees and agents (    <em>'the Indemnified Parties'</em>) , shall not be responsible for and
                    shall be <strong>exempt from, all liability</strong> in respect of loss
                    (financial or otherwise), damage, accident, injury, death, harm (as defined
                    in the Consumer Protection Act - CPA), illness, trauma, delay or
                    inconvenience to any Client (which shall be deemed to include the heirs,
                    executors, administrators or assigns of the Client    <strong>whether on the tour or journey or not</strong>), or loss of or
                    damage to their luggage, or other property, wherever, whenever and however
                    the same may occur and whether or not arising from any act, omission,
                    default, or negligence on the part of any of the Indemnified Parties
                    whatsoever, unless such claim is for injury or death and due to a negligent
                    act or omission of the Company. Such liability will be subject to a
                    limitation of R10 000.00 (Ten Thousand Rand) per Client per Booking. The
                    Client <strong>indemnifies and holds harmless</strong> the Indemnified
                    Parties accordingly. The Indemnified Parties shall furthermore not be
                    liable for any consequential or indirect loss or damage whatsoever, unless
                    section 61 of the CPA applies.

                    <strong>INSURANCE</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is strongly recommended that each client takes out comprehensive travel
                    insurance prior to travel. The Company will not be responsible or liable if
                    the Client fails to take adequate insurance cover or at all. It shall not
                    be obligatory upon the Company to effect insurance for the Client except
                    upon <strong>detailed instructions given in writing </strong>and all
                    insurance affected by the Company pursuant to such instruction will be
                    subject to such exceptions and conditions as may be imposed by the
                    insurance company or underwriters accepting the risk, and the Company shall
                    not be obliged to obtain separate cover for any risks so excluded. Should
                    the insurers dispute their liability for any reason, the Client will have
                    recourse against the insurers only. Once the insurance has been confirmed
                    and paid for, the Client will be issued with a    <strong>policy document of the insurer</strong>. It is a complex document,
                    which must be read BEFORE YOU initiate your travel so that you can address
                    any queries you may have to the insurer PRIOR to your departure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that various <strong>credit card companies </strong>offer
                    limited levels of travel insurance, which the Company does not consider
                    sufficient cover for international travel. Kindly check with the respective
                    credit card companies in order to obtain the specific details of the cover.

                    that All visitors to South Africa and all clients who are travelling from
                    RSA to another country are required to have a minimum of three (3) clear
                    visa pages in their passport excluding the front and back cover to enable
                    the entry visa to be issued – However in each case a further enquiry should
                    be addressed to the consulate or embassy of the relevant countries being
                    visited. If there is insufficient space in the passport entry will be
                    denied and the person is likely to be detained pending return to their
                    country of origin. Please ensure that all passports are renewed timeously.
                    The client must ensure that the details supplied to the Company mirror
                    those details shown on their passport for international travel and ID
                    documents for local travel. As a guideline, passports should be valid for 6
                    (six) months after your scheduled return to South Africa. Non-South African
                    passport holders may also be required to have re-entry documentation and it
                    is entirely the Client's duty to ensure that such documentation is in order
                    before departure.

                    conditions are met:
                </p>
                <p>
                    * The party invoking force majeure (    <em>'the Force Majeure Party' - 'FMP'</em>) must immediately advise the

                </p>
                <p>
                    * The Event must destroy the subject matter of the contract and means of
                    performance to such an extent that performance becomes permanently
                    impossible and NOT simply difficult, burdensome or economically onerous to
                    carry out;

                </p>
                <p>
                    * The FMP must mitigate its own damages;

                    Requirements;
                </p>
                <p>
                    * The Event must not be of a temporary nature but if it is anticipated to
                    endure for an unreasonably long period, it will be regarded as permanent

                <p>
                    * If the parties are in disagreement about the Definition or the Qualifying
                    Requirements, the parties will apply the Dispute Resolution clause of the
                    Conditions;
                </p>
                <p>
                    * If any one or more of the qualifying criteria are not met, the FMP will
                    have the option to agree a postponement with the FMR and the contract will
                    be performed at the postponed date or the FMP can cancel the contract and
                    the cancellation provisions will apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * If they are in agreement that the qualifying requirements have been met,
                    then parties will in the first instance use their best endeavours to agree
                    on the postponement of performance of the contract and failing consensus in
                    that regard, the FMR will use its best endeavours to reimburse the FMP all
                    monies received from it and paid to third party service providers which it
                    manages to recover less irrecoverable disbursements and a reasonable
                    management and service fee.

                    resolution of the dispute within 5 (five) days of their meeting, they will
                    attempt to resolve the matter by mediation – the mediator will be an

                    binding upon the parties and shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies
                    of the parties. All judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in
                    any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for
                    a judicial acceptance of the award or orders of enforcement. The

                    urgent application to any court that has jurisdiction if circumstances

                <p>
                    Whilst the Company acknowledges the Client's right of freedom to take
                    photographs in general, please note that the following conditions apply to
                    any photography during any tour and excursions with or arranged by the
                    Company whether during the tour or excursion or thereafter and these rules
                    will be strictly enforced. By the same token Clients are deemed to
                    indemnify the Company against any consequences, claims and legal costs (on
                    an attorney and own client scale) resulting from any breach of whatsoever
                    nature of these conditions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    · The copyright and ownership in the photograph (<em>'photo'</em>) will
                    remain vested in the person who took the photo, unless a person (    <em>'the Subject'</em>) asked for the photo to be taken and made an
                    arrangement to the contrary with the photographer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · However, once the photographer has posted any material on the Company
                    website or any form of social media, that entitles the Company or any third
                    party to disseminate it
                </p>
                <p>
                    · If the material is to be used commercially e.g. sold or used to launch an
                    advertising campaign, then the written permission of the Subject is
                    required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · The Company supports the principle of fair use and factors that will have
                    a bearing are the purpose (e.g. non-profit); nature of use; size e.g.
                    thumbnail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · Whilst you are entitled to take photos of individuals in public areas,
                    many public areas e.g. shopping centers, resorts and some of the places you
                    may visit may seem to be in the public domain but is in fact privately
                    owned and thus subject to the rules prescribed by the owner of which you
                    should be aware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · If the location where the photo is being taken is of such a nature that
                    it is reasonable to presume privacy, e.g. a bathroom, then the Client may
                    not take a photo of the Subject at all. This principle would also apply if
                    the location is e.g. a private game lodge which focuses on affluent clients
                    and celebrities or where the surrounds are evidently private - these
                    persons choose such venues for reasons of privacy and even an innocent
                    photo of a staff member posing with a celebrity may be of such a private
                    nature that both the photographer or the staff member requesting the photo
                    is advised to limit the usage to personal purposes and not disseminate it
                    e.g. via social media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · Use of the photo must not be of such a nature that e.g. it misrepresents
                    the Subject, the setting or surrounds.<strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    · The Company reserves the right to use photos of you and your party on its
                    website and for promotional purposes. If you wish to object to such use,
                    please advise the Company in writing prior to arrival. <strong></strong>

                    Clients are provided with travel and/or other services and/or goods either
                    by the Company itself or by Third Party Suppliers who it engages as agent
                    for the Client - they include airlines, vehicle rental, providers of
                    accommodation, food and beverage, golf courses, tour guides, excursions
                    etc. The <strong>contract in use by the Third Party Suppliers </strong>
                    (which is often constituted by the ticket issued by them), shall constitute
                    the sole contract between the Third Party Supplier and the Client and any
                    right of recourse the Client may have, will be solely against such Third
                    Party Supplier. The Company will on request provide the identity and terms
                    and conditions of (or access thereto) all the Third Party Suppliers
                    relevant to the service and/or goods being provided for the Client's
                    booking and it's the Client's responsibility to familiarise itself with
                    such terms and conditions (    <strong><em>'the Third Party Supplier's Conditions'</em></strong>). Whilst
                    the Company vets and selects the Third Party Suppliers with the utmost care
                    and circumspection, the Company accepts <strong>no liability</strong> for
                    any loss, damage, illness, harm, injury or death which any Client may
                    suffer or claim of whatever nature it may have as a result of any act or
                    omission on the part of or the failure of the Third Party Supplier to
                    fulfill any of its obligations, whether in relation to travel arrangements,
                    accommodation or otherwise unless, in the case of injury or death, it is

                    With regards to <strong>hotel bookings</strong> please be aware that hotels
                    and other accommodation properties (Collectively referred to as    <strong><em>'hotels'</em></strong>) may undergo renovations from time to
                    time. Hotels generally take all possible steps to limit disruption and
                    inconvenience to their guests when renovations are taking place. The
                    Company will not entertain complaints or requests for refunds if a hotel is
                    carrying out renovations whilst a guest is resident. If the Company is
                    specifically advised of renovation work in advance by the hotel, this

                    cover costs, disbursements incurred by the Company and its service fees. A
                    percentage of the deposit will be forfeited in the event of cancellation by

                    Payment policy is as per the Booking Confirmation.<strong> </strong>The    <strong>balance of the Package Price </strong>is due not later than 60 days
                    prior to arrival unless specified otherwise. If the final payment is not

                    charged by the Company's bank on any payment made after the due date. Late
                    payment may also result in cancellation of the reservation by any of the

                    once payment of the Package Price in full is received, the Package Price is    <strong>guaranteed </strong>(subject to statutory changes such as VAT).
                    However, should the number of traveling passengers deviate from the number
                    required for the booking as specified in the Booking Confirmation or should
                    unforeseen events lead to rescheduling by any principal, the Company
                    reserves the right to re-cost the Package Price and raise a surcharge to

                    damage to their luggage, or other property, wherever, whenever and however
                    the same may occur and whether or not arising from any act, omission,

                    <strong>INSURANCE</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is strongly recommended that each client takes out comprehensive travel
                    insurance prior to travel. The Company will not be responsible or liable if
                    the Client fails to take adequate insurance cover or at all. It shall not
                    be obligatory upon the Company to effect insurance for the Client except
                    upon <strong>detailed instructions given in writing </strong>and all
                    insurance affected by the Company pursuant to such instruction will be
                    subject to such exceptions and conditions as may be imposed by the
                    insurance company or underwriters accepting the risk, and the Company shall
                    not be obliged to obtain separate cover for any risks so excluded. Should
                    the insurers dispute their liability for any reason, the Client will have
                    recourse against the insurers only. Once the insurance has been confirmed
                    and paid for, the Client will be issued with a    <strong>policy document of the insurer</strong>. It is a complex document,
                    which must be read BEFORE YOU initiate your travel so that you can address
                    any queries you may have to the insurer PRIOR to your departure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that various <strong>credit card companies </strong>offer
                    limited levels of travel insurance, which the Company does not consider
                    sufficient cover for international travel. Kindly check with the respective
                    credit card companies in order to obtain the specific details of the cover.

                    that All visitors to South Africa and all clients who are travelling from
                    RSA to another country are required to have a minimum of three (3) clear
                    visa pages in their passport excluding the front and back cover to enable
                    the entry visa to be issued – However in each case a further enquiry should
                    be addressed to the consulate or embassy of the relevant countries being
                    visited. If there is insufficient space in the passport entry will be
                    denied and the person is likely to be detained pending return to their
                    country of origin. Please ensure that all passports are renewed timeously.
                    The client must ensure that the details supplied to the Company mirror
                    those details shown on their passport for international travel and ID
                    documents for local travel. As a guideline, passports should be valid for 6
                    (six) months after your scheduled return to South Africa. Non-South African
                    passport holders may also be required to have re-entry documentation and it
                    is entirely the Client's duty to ensure that such documentation is in order
                    before departure.

                </p>
                <p>
                    * The Event must destroy the subject matter of the contract and means of
                    performance to such an extent that performance becomes permanently
                    impossible and NOT simply difficult, burdensome or economically onerous to
                    carry out;
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    * The FMP must mitigate its own damages;
                </p>
                <p>
                    * The FMP must take all reasonable steps to avoid non-performance;

                    Requirements;
                </p>
                <p>
                    * The Event must not be of a temporary nature but if it is anticipated to
                    endure for an unreasonably long period, it will be regarded as permanent

                <p>
                    * If the parties are in disagreement about the Definition or the Qualifying
                    Requirements, the parties will apply the Dispute Resolution clause of the
                    Conditions;
                </p>
                <p>
                    * If any one or more of the qualifying criteria are not met, the FMP will
                    have the option to agree a postponement with the FMR and the contract will
                    be performed at the postponed date or the FMP can cancel the contract and
                    the cancellation provisions will apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    * If they are in agreement that the qualifying requirements have been met,
                    then parties will in the first instance use their best endeavours to agree
                    on the postponement of performance of the contract and failing consensus in
                    that regard, the FMR will use its best endeavours to reimburse the FMP all
                    monies received from it and paid to third party service providers which it
                    manages to recover less irrecoverable disbursements and a reasonable
                    management and service fee.

                    Even if you have obtained an international driver's licence, please take
                    your national driver's licence with you. Some overseas car rental companies

                    Where possible airport and airlines taxes and surcharges are reflected in
                    all prices. It should be noted that certain airlines invoke additional
                    taxes and/or surcharges if any changes are made to the tickets and/or
                    routing even if the ticket has been fully paid. Furthermore it is important
                    that you check with the Company prior to departure from South Africa what
                    the current airport departure tax is of all the countries you will be
                    passing though as these taxes are usually payable in the local currency and
                    must be provided for. With regards to accommodation, some countries city
                    tax and other taxes are only payable on check out.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Any and all dispute arising out of or in connection with the Conditions
                    including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination,
                    shall be dealt with as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1 Firstly the parties will meet within 5 (five) working days of the dispute
                    arising in an attempt to resolve the matter amicably. Failing such amicable
                    resolution of the dispute within 5 (five) days of their meeting, they will
                    attempt to resolve the matter by mediation – the mediator will be an
                    independent third party mutually agreed upon and, failing such mutual
                    agreement, a party appointed as a mediator by the Arbitration Foundation of
                    South Africa ('AFSA'), which mediator must be appointed within 5 (five)
                    days of their failing to resolve the matter amicably and the mediation
                    itself must take place with a further 5 (five) days from the date the
                    mediator is appointed. Failing such amicable resolution of the dispute by
                    the intervention of a mediator, the dispute must be referred to arbitration
                    in Cape Town within two (2) days of the failure to resolve the dispute by
                    the intervention of a mediator, which referral must be delivered in writing
                    to and be conducted in terms of the rules of AFSA for the time being in
                    force which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this
                    clause. The tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator to be appointed
                    pursuant to the AFSA Rules. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and
                    binding upon the parties and shall provide the sole and exclusive remedies
                    of the parties. All judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in
                    any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for
                    a judicial acceptance of the award or orders of enforcement. The
                    commencement of any arbitration proceedings under this Clause shall in no
                    way affect the continual performance of the obligations relates to the
                    subject matter of such proceedings. All arbitration proceedings shall be in
                    the English Language.

                <p>
                    2 Notwithstanding the provisions of this clause, either party may bring an
                    urgent application to any court that has jurisdiction if circumstances
                    arise that merit such an application.

                    <strong>PHOTOGRAPHY</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whilst the Company acknowledges the Client's right of freedom to take
                    photographs in general, please note that the following conditions apply to
                    any photography during any tour and excursions with or arranged by the
                    Company whether during the tour or excursion or thereafter and these rules
                    will be strictly enforced. By the same token Clients are deemed to
                    indemnify the Company against any consequences, claims and legal costs (on
                    an attorney and own client scale) resulting from any breach of whatsoever
                    nature of these conditions:
                </p>
                <p>
                    · The copyright and ownership in the photograph (<em>'photo'</em>) will
                    remain vested in the person who took the photo, unless a person (    <em>'the Subject'</em>) asked for the photo to be taken and made an
                    arrangement to the contrary with the photographer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · However, once the photographer has posted any material on the Company
                    website or any form of social media, that entitles the Company or any third
                    party to disseminate it
                </p>
                <p>
                    · If the material is to be used commercially e.g. sold or used to launch an
                    advertising campaign, then the written permission of the Subject is
                    required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · The Company supports the principle of fair use and factors that will have
                    a bearing are the purpose (e.g. non-profit); nature of use; size e.g.
                    thumbnail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · Whilst you are entitled to take photos of individuals in public areas,
                    many public areas e.g. shopping centers, resorts and some of the places you
                    may visit may seem to be in the public domain but is in fact privately
                    owned and thus subject to the rules prescribed by the owner of which you
                    should be aware.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · If the location where the photo is being taken is of such a nature that
                    it is reasonable to presume privacy, e.g. a bathroom, then the Client may
                    not take a photo of the Subject at all. This principle would also apply if
                    the location is e.g. a private game lodge which focuses on affluent clients
                    and celebrities or where the surrounds are evidently private - these
                    persons choose such venues for reasons of privacy and even an innocent
                    photo of a staff member posing with a celebrity may be of such a private
                    nature that both the photographer or the staff member requesting the photo
                    is advised to limit the usage to personal purposes and not disseminate it
                    e.g. via social media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    · Use of the photo must not be of such a nature that e.g. it misrepresents
                    the Subject, the setting or surrounds.<strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    · The Company reserves the right to use photos of you and your party on its
                    website and for promotional purposes. If you wish to object to such use,
                    please advise the Company in writing prior to arrival. <strong></strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>ENTIRE CONTRACT</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Conditions (together with all enquiries, advice, quotations or
                    estimates addressed to, provided by or bookings made and indemnities signed
                    and the Company's Privacy Policy) constitute collectively the entire terms
                    of the relationship between the parties. There exist no other terms,
                    conditions, warranties, representations, guarantees, promises, undertaking
                    or inducements of any nature whatsoever regulating the relationship and the
                    Client acknowledges that he/she has not relied on any matter or thing
                    stated <u>or presented</u> on behalf of the Company or otherwise that is
                    not included herein. The contra proferentem rule will not apply to the
                    interpretation of the Conditions. The Company reserves the right to revise
                    these conditions from time to time - each revision will be dated and posted
                    on its website.
