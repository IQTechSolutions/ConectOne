                    A cookie is a small amount of information that is downloaded to your

                    the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login and
                    region selection). This means you do not have to re-enter this information
                    each time you return to the site or browse from one page to another.
                    Cookies also provide information on how people use the website, for
                    instance, whether it is their first time visiting or if they are a frequent

                    Some cookies are necessary to allow you to browse our website, use its
                    features, and access secure areas. The use of these cookies is essential
                    for the website to work. For example, we use user-input cookies for the

                    that span several pages.

                    region you are in. This allows us to tailor your website experience
                    specifically to your preferences. For example, authentication cookies are
                    functional cookies that are used for the duration of a session (or
                    persistent, if you agree to the "remember me" function) to allow users to
                    authenticate themselves on subsequent visits or to gain access to
                    authorized content across pages. The functional cookies we use include:

                <p>
                    We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from
                    time to time, like web beacons, SDKs, pixels (or "clear gifs") and other
                    tracking technologies. Pixels are tiny graphics files that contain a unique
                    identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our PRO
                    GOLF SAFARIS AND GOLF TOURS (PTY) LTD Site or, in the case of web beacons,
                    opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to
                    monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one page within our @Configuration["ApplicationConfiguration:AppliactionName"].ToUpper()
                    SAFARIS AND GOLF TOURS (PTY) LTD Site to another, to deliver or communicate
                    with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our @Configuration["ApplicationConfiguration:AppliactionName"].ToUpper() SAFARIS
                    AND GOLF TOURS (PTY) LTD Site from an online advertisement displayed on a
                    third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others
                    like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of
                    marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically
                    reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these
                    technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in
                    those instances, declining cookies will impair the functionality of these
                    technologies.

                    The length of time that a cookie remains on your computer or mobile device
                    depends on whether it is a "persistent" or "session" cookie. Session
                    cookies last until you stop browsing and persistent cookies last until they
                    expire or are deleted. Most of the cookies we use are persistent and will
                    expire between 30 minutes and two years from the date they are downloaded
                    to your device. See the section below on how to control cookies for more
                    information on removing them before they expire.
